# Doceree-ML-Hackathon
# 2nd Runner Up - Team Karasuno<br>
Month long Machine Learning Hackathon organized by Doceree and TechGig.  The hackathon revolved around analyzing ad server logs, which contained critical information about user behavior, including browser details, IP addresses, geographic locations, search patterns, site URLs, and other relevant data. The main objective was to build a model that could accurately predict whether a user belonged to the HCP (Healthcare Professional) category and discern their specialization id/taxonomy, representing their specific area of expertise within the healthcare field.
